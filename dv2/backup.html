    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Europe has been making significant progress in its energy landscapes. From the many policies and regulations implemented, Europe's transition into
      renewable energy sources is not just a trend, but a commitment to creating a cleaner and more sustainable future. The visualisation aims to uncover the evolving energy trends across European nations
        and offer compelling insight into their energy consumption pattern from 2010 to 2019.

    <h3 style = "text-align: center;"> The choropleth map below shows the amount of renewable energy consumed per capita by each country 
      in Europe. Countries with higher usage of renewable energy are shown in <font color="#23479c">blue </font> while countries with lesser usage of renewable energy are
    in <font color="#dbf1b4">yellow </font>. From the map, we can see that countries that are futher up north (Norway, Finland, etc) have a higher usage of renewable energy. As the years progress, almost all countries
    in the Europe continent have increased their usage of renewable energy.

    <h3 style = "text-align: center;padding: 20px;">The line chart below compares the <b>annual change in primary energy consumption in Europe to Europe's estimated population from 2010 to 2019</b>. Primary energy refers
      to the energy consumed for various purposes, such as electricity generation, heating, transportation, and more.
      As seen, even though Europe's population is rising steadily, which means increased demand for more electricity. Despite that, Europe that managed to achieved negative
      annual change, meaning they were able to generate more electricty and power using less primary energy.

          Donut chart for Annual Renewable Energy Mix</h2>

        <p style = "text-align: center; padding: 10px;">The donut chart shows the annual energy mix in Europe. This interactive donut chart provides a snapshot of how various renewable energy sources
          contribute to the total energy consumption in a given year. By sliding through the Year slider, it can be seen that solar energy has become a growing importance in the generation of
          energy for Europe. <b>From 2010 to 2019, the contribution of solar energy to the overall renewable energy generation in Europe has increase by 4 times.</b>
