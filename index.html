    <h2 style = "background-color: #7ca1cc; padding: 10px; border: 0px solid black;">Europe has been making significant progress in its energy landscapes. From the many policies and regulations implemented, Europe's transition into
      renewable energy sources is not just a trend, but a commitment to creating a cleaner and more sustainable future. The visualisation aims to uncover the evolving energy trends across European nations
        and offer compelling insight into their energy consumption pattern from 2010 to 2019.

      Renewable Energy Consumption in Europe, per capita</h2>
      <hr>
    <p style = "text-align: center; margin-top: 15px">Countries with higher usage of renewable energy are shown in <font color="#23479c">blue </font> while countries with lesser usage of renewable energy are
    in <font color="#45b4c2"> green</font>. From the map, we can see that countries that are futher up north (Norway, Finland, etc) have a higher usage of renewable energy. As the years progress, almost all countries
    in the Europe continent have increased their usage of renewable energy.

      Europe's Annual Change In Primary Energy Consumption</h2>
      <hr>
    <p style = "text-align: center;padding: 20px; margin-top: -15px">
      Even though Europe's population is rising steadily, which means increased demand for more electricity, <b>Europe has managed to achieved negative
      annual change in primary energy consumption in 5 out of 10 years</b>, meaning they were able to generate more electricity and power using less primary energy. All this can be credited to their strict
      energy efficiency regulations and incentives implemented.

      Total Renewable Energy Growth</h2>
      <hr>
    <p style = "text-align: center;padding: 20px; margin-top: -15px"><b>Almost all countries have at least a 50% growth with Cyprus having 
      the most significant growth of almost 400%</b>. Some exceptions here are countries like Iceland and Norway which have recorded growth less than 30%, however both this countries were already producing most of their energy from renewable sources since 2010,
      hence the minor increase.

          Snapshot Of Europe's Annual Renewable Energy Mix</h2>
          <hr>

        <p style = "text-align: center; padding: 10px; margin-top: -5px">This interactive donut chart provides a snapshot of how various renewable energy sources
          contribute to the total energy consumption in a given year. By sliding through the Year slider, it can be seen that <font color="fc8d62">solar energy</font> has become a growing importance in the generation of
          energy for Europe. <b>From 2010 to 2019, the contribution of <font color="fc8d62">solar energy</font> to the overall renewable energy generation in Europe has increased by 4 times.</b> Percentage of <font color="a6d854">wind energy</font> has also increased by 2 times
          within this time period, signifiying Europe's strategy to diversify their energy sources and not rely too heavily on hydropower.
